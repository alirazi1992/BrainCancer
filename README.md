## What's Inside `Untitled1.ipynb`

- **Data Loading & Cleaning** ‚Äî prepare dataset for analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** ‚Äî understand variables, distributions, and correlations.

- **Visualization** ‚Äî histograms, scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, etc.

- **Modeling Section** ‚Äî regression or classification modeling (e.g., decision trees, logistic regression).

- **Model Evaluation** ‚Äî accuracy, ROC curve, confusion matrix, or regression metrics.

- **Notes & Insights** ‚Äî markdown cells explaining observations, conclusions, or next steps.

## Recommendations for Enhancements

- Rename the notebook to a descriptive title (e.g., `BrainCancer_EDA_Modeling.ipynb`)

- If expanding to a complete project:

    - Add structured modules (data processing, modeling, evaluation)
    - Track dependencies in `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`

     - Export a rendered HTML version of the notebook for sharing or archival
